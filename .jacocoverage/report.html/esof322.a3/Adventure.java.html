/**  Adventure Game  Program Code
Copyright (c) 1999-2012 James M. Bieman
The Adventure game is based on the &quot;Colossal Cave Adventure&quot; originally
designed by Will Crowther and implemented by Will Crowther
and Don Wood in Fortran in 1975 and 1976.

This micro-version is a variant of the original cave system and is implemented in Java
with just a few rooms and with a much more limited vocabulary.

Updated August 2010, January 2012
- Code is put into package cs314.a2 to match current CS314 coding standards.
Updated January 2012
- Renamed as the &quot;Adventure Game&quot;

To compile: javac cs314.a2.AdventureGame.java
To run:     java cs314.a2.AdventureGame

The main routine is AdventureGame.main

/** class Adventure: Primary method, createCave, creates the cave system.
        It eventually be replaced with a more flexible mechanism
        to support input and output from devices other than
        an ASCII terminal.

		Room descriptions are followed by a room identifier,
		to ease debugging and testing.  These would be removed
		to help confuse the user, which is our ultimate aim.

		I haven't added all of the room descriptions.  They
		will be done later.
		
		In this version all I/O is through standard I/O;
		I/O is to and from the console.
